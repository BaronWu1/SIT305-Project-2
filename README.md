# Henry Comments 17/April #
- Rename worklog to changelog
- You have two readme files (one of them isn't yours - delete that one)
- You still need many many more updates to Pass. I'll give you until this Sunday to catch up at least 2 commits each of at least 5 hours work each, and then I'll overlook the missing Week 3 + 4 + 5 work.
